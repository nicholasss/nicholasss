### Currently:
I am teaching myself backend via Golang & Node.js, along with PostgreSQL, SQLite3, and MongoDB.
Always looking for patterns, methods, ideas, etc. that I can use to write better backends.

### Goals:
- Comprehensive understanding of Docker and Kubernetes, gained from first-hand use, to orchestrate development of complex or intricate services, either on-prem or cloud.
- Fundamental understanding of, and experience with, functional backend languages, such as Elixir (BEAM), or Scala (JVM).
- Utilize a robust CI/CD pipeline, with GH Actions, Jenkins, or Docker, for security auditing, automated testing, coverage tracking, as well as the goal: deployment.

### Hobbies & Interests
- Electronics
- Mathematics
- Computer Keyboards
- GIS & Maps
- Cooking & Baking

### History:
After completing my first GIS Contract, I decided to go a completely different direction. I leaned on my technical experience of Windows and macOS troubleshooting and maintenance, as well as numerous electronic repairs and building gaming PC's. IT Desktop Support.

I loved the complex problems and creating, providing, and surfacing solutions. It was a job that fundamentally enabled daily work, reduced friction, and supported organizational successes. However, the longer I worked in IT, the most interested I became in programming...

For the longest time, it was an interest or hobby, I had dabbled in it before. Trying to make an app, write a script, or automate workflows. The unmotivated interest quickly compounded into a mature passion. Before I knew it, I was spending two hours programming every morning.

Just as my early skills began to form, a family emergency necessitated major changes and hard decisions. I choose this moment to actively pursue my long-standing passion for programming, and I am extremely thankful to my wife and family who have encouraged and supported me.

### My Approach to AI Tools:

#### *I'm studying how to write better software.* It's important to make solutions that I can understand and apply elsewhere.

In order to reach my goal of being a well-rounded backend software engineer, I do not utilize AI in order to take shortcuts. If I were to utilize AI to write code on my behalf, analyze problems, or interpret an error message, I am only robbing myself of the opportunity to improve my skills.

Of course I utilize AI these days as an aspiring programmer. My approach is to take pride in both comprehensively understanding the challenges I face, and creating a satisfying and robust solution.

For me, the best opporunities are interesting and complex challenges that let you learn from your mistakes. Each challenge is a chance to build skills and an enchanced understanding of the problem itself.

### Fun Facts:
I am an A2 to B1 in German, and just started learning Spanish as well.
I graduated with a degree in Geography and am proficient in GIS, which would explain why I am a regular contributer to OpenStreetMap. :)
